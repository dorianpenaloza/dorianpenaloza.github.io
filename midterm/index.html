                <h3>PRINCIPLES OF SHOE FIT</h3>
                <p>It is our belief that a running shoe that fits and feels in such a way that it almost disappears on the foot, that it feels like an extension of your foot or that is intuitively most comfortable will be the shoe that benefits you the most. But that is not the entire solution.</p>
